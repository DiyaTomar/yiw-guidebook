            'Hello everyone! My name is Haley Mitchell and I attended the Year in Wise program in the 2022-2023 school year. I am currently a rising sophomore and I am an intended Psychology major. This program is truly a unique experience. I know right now this program may feel like a huge detour, but I assure you that it won’t be as bad. The program is really is what you make of it. I would recommend researching which classes transfer using the Transfer Credit Analyzer. As a psych major, there were almost no classes that transferred, so I finished almost all of my gen ed’s by the time I got to UVA. As long as you play your cards right, you will not be behind as a transfer student. Also, make sure you know what APs/dual enrollments you have and what they get you out of at UVA. Make sure to find things to do that you enjoy. There are many things to do and if you want to do something that isn’t there, make it yourself. I know plenty of people who started their own clubs. My last tip is to reach out to others and just make the most of it. I know this can be a scary transition, but all of the people in this program are in the same situation. That, in itself, is something that already connects you.I would also encourage you to connect with people outside of the program. There are a lot of nice students and professors that you can make invaluable relationships with despite leaving in the coming year. My favorite thing about this program was that I got the small school experience. That means that there were so many more opportunities for us than there would be at a larger school. This could mean getting a spot at a Studio Ghibli pottery class or even just being able to get a popsicle after class. This is only really possible at a school where there are about 2,000 people compared to UVA with more than 17,000. Whether you view this as an exciting experience or a bridge to UVA, I urge you to move into this with a positive mindset and make the most of your experience. If you think UVA is the school for you, don’t hesitate to take this opportunity. I wish you the best of luck in the upcoming school year!',

            "Hey! My name is Rahul Sunilkumar and I am an aspiring Commerce major (meaning I will be applying to McIntire's B.S. in Commerce Major in my second year). The Year in Wise program was most definitely a year of trials and tribulations, and it was difficult seeing all my friends at UVA while we were 7 hours apart. However, the grass always seems greener on the other side, and if you are determined to be a UVA student, the UVA Wise Program is for you. Embrace the landscape, the people, and the culture, and take the reigns of your time here. I enjoyed intramural/club volleyball, competing in the Entrepreneurship Cup, Table Tennis tournaments, the extra math/legal lectures, starting up Chess Club, hiking High Knob, and going to the occasionally decent parties. Class-wise, I enjoyed Linear Algebra, Logic, and Macro/Micro courses - great professors and good content. Logic is a great way to get your philosophy credit. The first year of college is a significant one, no matter where you go. Be smart and plan ahead for what you want at UVA. Do your best to shine because this is your chance to be a big fish in a little pond, because UVA is an ocean. Best of luck and hope to see you at UVA.",

            "Although I was not too keen on going to the University of Virginia's College at Wise, I was pleasantly surprised. The campus is well kept and the university prides itself in their close knit community. Everyone is welcoming and fitting in and finding friends is as smooth as can be. One thing I really enjoyed and took advantage of from the university was their smaller class sizes. This made it very easy to receive help directly from the professors and ask questions at any time. What I would recommend to incoming students is to appreciate this small community, enjoy yourself and your time with others around you. You&apos;ll see the same people everyday, but value this time, because before you know it, you won't see many of those faces again. The Year in Wise program did truly impact me and I cherish the memories I made during my time in Wise.",
