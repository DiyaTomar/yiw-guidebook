            "Hello everyone! My name is Haley Mitchell and I went through the Year in Wise program in the 2022-2023 school year. I am currently a rising sophomore and I am an intended Psychology major. This program is truly a unique experience. I know right now this program may feel like a huge detour, but I assure you that it won’t be as bad. I will not lie to you and say that everyone loves this program, but it really is what you make of it. My first tip is to not rely on your advisor (this is true for almost every university). It is up to you to do your research on what classes actually transfer (there is a nice page on what transfers on the internet). As a psych major, there were almost no classes that transferred, so I finished almost all of my gen ed's by the time I got to UVA. As long as you play your cards right, you will not be behind as a transfer student. Also, make sure you know what APs/dual enrollments you have and what they get you out of AT UVA. My advisor tried to put me in classes I got out of. Even so, there will be some courses that are mandatory despite having APs/dual enrollments. My second tip is to find things to do that you enjoy. This could be something like honor court or clubs. There are many things to do and if you want to do something that isn’t there, make it yourself. I know plenty of people who started their own clubs. My last tip is to reach out to others and just make the most of it. I know this can be a scary transition, but all of the people in this program are in the same situation. That, in itself, is something that already connects you. I would also encourage you to connect with people outside of the program. There are a lot of nice students and professors that you can make invaluable relationships with despite leaving in the coming year. My favorite thing about this program was that I got the small school experience. That means that there were so many more opportunities for us than there would be at a larger school. This could mean getting a spot at a Studio Ghibli pottery class or even just being able to get a popsicle after class. This is only really possible at a school where there are about 2,000 people compared to UVA with more than 17,000. Whether you view this as an exciting experience or a bridge to UVA, I urge you to move into this with a positive mindset and make the most of your experience. If you think UVA is the school for you, don’t hesitate to take this opportunity. I wish you the best of luck in the upcoming school year!",

            "Although I was not too keen on going to the University of Virginia's College at Wise, I was pleasantly surprised. The campus is well kept and the university prides itself in their close knit community. Everyone is welcoming and fitting in and finding friends is as smooth as can be. One thing I really enjoyed and took advantage of from the university was their smaller class sizes. This made it very easy to receive help directly from the professors and ask questions at any time. What I would recommend to incoming students is to appreciate this small community, enjoy yourself and your time with others around you. You&apos;ll see the same people everyday, but value this time, because before you know it, you won't see many of those faces again. The Year in Wise program did truly impact me and I cherish the memories I made during my time in Wise.",
