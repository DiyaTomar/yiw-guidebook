            'UVA Wise adopted an Honor System in 1956 under which all students pledge to cooperate in acting honestly and honorable. The Honor System is administered by an Honor Court composed of two representatives from each class. Upper class representatives are elected by the student body each spring and freshmen representatives are elected after the start of the fall semester. It is the job of the Honor Court to enforce the Honor System and to adjudicate violations. The Honor Court office and conference room are located in the Student Leadership Wing on the third floor of the Slemp Student Center.',
