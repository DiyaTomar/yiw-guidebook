        question: 'I’ve been waitlisted by UVA, what does that actually mean?',
        answer: 'You may think that you ended up on the waitlist because UVA doesn’t actually want you. The opposite is true. The easiest thing for UVA to do would be to reject you, but they have placed you on the waitlist because they earnestly hope that you will end up in Charlottesville next year.',

        question:
            'Rather than go to UVA-Wise for my freshman year, why can’t I just stay at home and take community college classes?',
        answer: 'You can, but there are no guarantees. UVA-Wise has a commitment from UVA to automatically transfer courses for the Year in Wise students. No other institution has that. If you decide to take the “stay at home” route, there is no guarantee that any of the local classes will transfer and if you don’t do well in a class, it could jeopardize your admissions status at UVA. We are your guaranteed path to Charlottesville and you’ll arrive there, on time, as a sophomore.',

        question: 'What is the background of this program?',
        answer: 'It began in 2019 with the first class of 24. The second year we had 25. In 2021, I began actively recruiting waitlisted students and it grew to 78. In 2022, we had 70. We project 81 for 2023-2024.',

        question: 'How does the program work?',
        answer: 'You will come to UVA-Wise and complete 30 semester hours in the Fall and Spring semesters with a GPA of 3.0 or better. You can take as many hours as you want, even in the summer, but you have to complete the requirements during the Fall and Spring.',

        question: 'Are there required courses?',
        answer: 'Yes, you are required to complete HIS 1850-Introduction to Appalachian Studies (3 hours), SEM 1010-Freshman Seminar (1 hour), and an upper-level Appalachia focused course (3 hours).',
